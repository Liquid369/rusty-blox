# RustyBlox Configuration Example
# ========================================
# Copy this file to config.toml and edit the values below

[paths]
# Database path for RocksDB storage
db_path = "./data/blocks.db"

# Directory containing PIVX blockchain files (blk*.dat)
# Linux default: ~/.pivx/blocks
# macOS default: ~/Library/Application Support/PIVX/blocks
# Windows default: %APPDATA%\PIVX\blocks

# PIVX data directory (contains leveldb index)
# Same path prefix as blk_dir

[sync]
# Fast sync mode: skip UTXO tracking during initial sync for 10-20x speedup
# Recommended: true for initial sync, false for archival/full nodes
fast_sync = true

# Automatically build address index after sync completes
# This enables address lookup and balance queries
# Recommended: true for block explorers
enrich_addresses = true

# Build UTXO set during sync
# Only used when fast_sync = false
# Recommended: false unless you need UTXO tracking
build_utxo = false

# Parallel file processing: number of concurrent blk*.dat files to process
# Higher = faster but more CPU/memory usage
# Recommended: 4-8 for 4-8 core systems, up to 16 for high-end systems
parallel_files = 8

[rpc]
# PIVX Core RPC connection settings
# Must match your pivx.conf configuration
host = "http://127.0.0.1:51472"
user = "your_rpc_username"
pass = "your_secure_rpc_password"

[server]
# Web server bind address
# Use 0.0.0.0 to allow external connections
# Use 127.0.0.1 for localhost-only access
host = "0.0.0.0"

# Web server port for API and WebSocket
port = 3005

# Number of worker threads for the web server
# Recommended: match your CPU core count
